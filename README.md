# 02_ResponsivePortfolio
Assignment 02 - Create a responsive portfolio that includes a navbar, responsive layout, and responsive images.

DESCRIPTION
The goal of this project was to create a mobile responsive portfolio for myself. 

I started by deciding how many pages I wanted to have and decided on 4. index.html for the homepage, and an about.html, contact.html, and portfolio.html. I used Bootstrap's default CSS & JS to add a Navbar at the top of each page. Then I built a customized footer that links to my social media from every page. I then built out each page. For the about page I included images and text to introduce myself. On the contact page I included a form that collects first name, last name, email, phone number, and then a custom message. On the portfolio page I included multiple cards with images, headlines, and text highlighting some of the main information on the website. Then I brought it all together by including the about and contact content on the index.html page on all screen sizes and added the portfolio on screens size large or larger.
