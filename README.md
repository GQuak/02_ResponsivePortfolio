# 02_ResponsivePortfolio
Assignment 02 - Create a responsive portfolio that includes a navbar, responsive layout, and responsive images.

<!-- DESCRIPTION
The goal of this project was to review and refactor the code for Horiseon's homepage with an emphasis on following proper accessibility standards. 

The first change I made was to implement proper semantic html tags to improve the accessability of the page. I broke it down into the header, two body sections, and a footer. I broke each section into 3 articles by related content & images. Then I adjusted the style.css file to align the classes with the new semantic html. I also consolidated duplicate classes that had identically styling into a single class that could be applied multiple times in the html. I have included comments to the index.html & style.css files explaining what the code does and why it's necessary. -->
